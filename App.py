    # Arithmetic Functions
    st.header("Arithmetic Functions")
    st.write("""
        Excel provides several basic arithmetic functions that help with simple calculations:

        - **SUM()**: Adds numbers in a range of cells.
            Example: 
            ```excel
            =SUM(A1:A10)  # Adds the values in cells A1 through A10
            ```
        - **SUBTOTAL()**: Calculates subtotals for data in a table or range.
            Example: 
            ```excel
            =SUBTOTAL(9, A1:A10)  # The "9" argument calculates the sum
            ```
        - **PRODUCT()**: Multiplies all the numbers in a range.
            Example: 
            ```excel
            =PRODUCT(A1:A5)  # Multiplies the values in cells A1 to A5
            ```
        - **AVERAGE()**: Calculates the average of a range of numbers.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =AVERAGE(A1:A10)  # Returns the average of cells A1 through A10
            ```
        - **MIN() / MAX()**: Returns the minimum or maximum value in a range.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =MIN(A1:A10)  # Returns the smallest number in the range
            =MAX(A1:A10)  # Returns the largest number in the range
            ```

        These arithmetic functions are the building blocks of most calculations in Excel.

    # Lookup & Reference Functions
    st.header("Lookup & Reference Functions")
    st.write("""
        These functions help you search for values in a range or table and return related information:

        - **VLOOKUP()**: Searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from another column.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =VLOOKUP(A1, B2:D10, 3, FALSE)  # Looks for value in A1, searches in columns B to D, returns value from 3rd column
            ```
        - **HLOOKUP()**: Similar to **VLOOKUP**, but it searches for a value in the first row of a table and returns a value in the same column from another row.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =HLOOKUP(A1, A2:F6, 3, FALSE)  # Looks for value in A1, searches in rows A to F, returns value from 3rd row
            ```
        - **INDEX()**: Returns the value of a cell in a specific row and column within a range.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =INDEX(A1:B10, 2, 1)  # Returns value in 2nd row, 1st column
            ```
        - **MATCH()**: Returns the position of a value in a range.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =MATCH("Apple", A1:A10, 0)  # Finds the position of "Apple" in the range A1 to A10
            ```
        - **OFFSET()**: Returns a value based on a reference cell and offset from that reference.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =OFFSET(A1, 2, 3)  # Returns the value 2 rows down and 3 columns to the right of cell A1
            ```

        These functions are useful when you need to find and return specific data from a table or range.

    # Logical Functions
    st.header("Logical Functions")
    st.write("""
        Logical functions help you make decisions based on conditions:

        - **IF()**: Performs a conditional test and returns one value if true and another if false.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =IF(A1 > 10, "High", "Low")  # Returns "High" if value in A1 is greater than 10, else "Low"
            ```
        - **AND() / OR()**: Returns TRUE if all conditions are true (**AND**) or if at least one condition is true (**OR**).
            Example:
            ```excel
            =AND(A1 > 10, B1 < 5)  # Returns TRUE if both conditions are true
            =OR(A1 > 10, B1 < 5)  # Returns TRUE if at least one condition is true
            ```
        - **IFERROR()**: Returns a custom value if a formula returns an error, otherwise returns the formula result.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =IFERROR(A1/B1, "Error")  # If division results in an error, returns "Error"
            ```
        - **NOT()**: Reverses the logic of a condition.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =NOT(A1 > 10)  # Returns TRUE if A1 is not greater than 10
            ```

    # Text Functions
    st.header("Text Functions")
    st.write("""
        Excel has many text functions for manipulating text strings:

            =CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)  # Joins values from A1 and B1 with a space between them
            ```
        - **TEXT()**: Formats a number as text with a specific format.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =TEXT(A1, "dd/mm/yyyy")  # Formats the date in A1 as day/month/year
            ```
        - **LEFT() / RIGHT()**: Extracts a specific number of characters from the left or right of a string.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =LEFT(A1, 3)  # Extracts the first 3 characters from A1
            =RIGHT(A1, 3)  # Extracts the last 3 characters from A1
            ```
        - **MID()**: Extracts a specific number of characters from the middle of a string.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =MID(A1, 2, 3)  # Extracts 3 characters from A1 starting from the 2nd character
            ```
        - **TRIM()**: Removes leading and trailing spaces from a text string.
            Example:
            ```excel
            =TRIM(A1)  # Removes spaces before and after the text in A1
